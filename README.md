# Sample Portfolio Website

This portfolio website showcases my projects and skills. It consists of two main files: `index.html` for the webpage structure and `style.css` for styling.

## Deployment

The website is deployed on GitHub Pages, and you can access it [here](https://suryakantm24.github.io/SamplePortfolio/).

## Customization

To edit the content of the portfolio, make changes in `index.html`. Customize the styles by modifying the `style.css` file.

Feel free to personalize the content and styles to make this portfolio website uniquely yours. Show off your skills and projects with pride!
